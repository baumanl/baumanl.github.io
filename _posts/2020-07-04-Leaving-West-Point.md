title: Leaving West Point

Almost exactly 3 years ago, I reported to the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point to begin the journey from civilian to Army officer. About 10 months ago, I made the decision to not affirm and leave USMA to complete my education at a civilian university. The purpose of this post is to give some insight into the factors I considered when making my decision to leave. When I was debating my decision I scoured the internet to find the stories of others who chose to leave. No two people have the identical reasons for leaving or staying, but I hope my story can help provide others struggling with the decision with another perspective.

### Affirmation

First, for any non-cadets, here is a brief overview of the Affirmation process and the commitments required of graduates. After 4 (tuition-free) years, cadets graduate and commission as second lieutenants in the U.S. Army. In exchange for their education and training, graduates owe the military 5 years of active duty service and 3 years on reserve status. Cadets are allowed their first two years to decide whether they are willing to make this commitment or if they would rather leave. This decision is formalized in a ceremony called "Affirmation" (as in, they are "affirming" their initial decision to join the Army from two years earlier). If a cadet leaves West Point before Affirmation they owe the military nothing, but if they choose to leave after Affirmation they must pay the Army back for the value of all of the training and education they recieved as a cadet: an exhorbitant sum.

### The Right Reasons

My first piece of advice for any cadet or cadet-candidate is to think about your goals early and often. Keep a journal and write down your thoughts: the good and the bad. Looking back on your doubts, failures, insecurities, and fears is just as important as remembering the laughter, success, and comraderie when evaluating the decision to stay or leave. Trying to remember past emotional states is difficult; having a physical record of your emotions and thoughts is extremely helpful when making any life decision. At a minimum, you should know (or be working to figure out) what ultimate goal you are working toward and how you are working to get closer to that goal. 

Ideally, entering West Point, you should have a solid idea of why you want to be in the Army, what you want to do in the Army, and so on.The mistake I made in high school was confusing West Point with my end destination. In high school I was so focused on getting into West Point, so sure that it was what I wanted--no, *needed* to do--that I failed to realize West Point (and college in general) is just a stepping stone to a future career and life. 

I wanted to go to West Point because it was the biggest/baddest/hardest thing high school me could imagine. I obsessed about West Point culture (so embarrassing), but didn't even bother to learn all the Army branches till after arriving as a cadet. Some cadets come because their parents want them to. Some come because they want to play a sport. Some come because it is free. In the end it is not important why you *come* West Point. The reason you *stay* is a million times more important.

Like any life  


about Affirmation early and oftern. Be honest to yourself about why you initially chose to attend West Point and what you want to do in the future. I worked my ass off for my entire high school career to get into West Point. I would literally look at the West Point Admissions Office website and make a checklist of everything they desired in an ideal candidate.
